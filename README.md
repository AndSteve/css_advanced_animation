# css_advanced_animation

## Create a spinning div
- Create a div
  - starting from the center of the page (like the hand of a clock in the middle of the clock face)
  - make it 1 pixel hight, 50vw wide
  - using CSS animation, 
    - make it contintuously rotate clockwise or counterclockwise.
    - animation should take at least 1 second
- Create a second div
  - turn div into a circle, give it a black border of 1-3 pixels solid
  - this div should be a child of the previous div
  - cause this div to bounce back and forth within the long dimension of the parent.  IE from the left side to the right side
  - animation should repeat endlessly
- create a button in the bottom of the page
  - upon pressing the button:
    - should randomize the color of the border of the second div
    - should clone the second div onto the page, leaving it exactly where it was at that moment (not pinned into the spinning div)

- When done, click on the button once.  Then hold down your space bar.
